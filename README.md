# React Weather App

## Description 

This is a Weather App built with React that allows you to search for the current weather as well as the predicted forecast for a given place. This app uses OpenWeather's public weather API to retrieve its data to produce the weather forecast for over 200.000 cities or any location by coordinates across the world. The API is accessible at [https://openweathermap.org]( https://openweathermap.org).


## Features

This React Weather App allows you to access the current weather and the forecast for the next four days of over 200.000 cities across the world. Alternatively, you can also access the weather forecast based on your current coordinates by using the “use current location” feature. The weather forecast includes the current temperature, wind speed, humidity and “feels like” temperature at the time of access from the latest weather update available.  Additionally, it gives you the weather prediction for the following four days and its minimum and maximum temperature. This app also features an animated loading screen of the sun rising and setting behind mountains.
